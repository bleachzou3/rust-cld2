[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emk/rust-cld2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emk/rust-cld2)

This Rust library detects the language of a string using the
[cld2 library][cld2] from the Chromium project.

To use it, add the following lines to your `Cargo.toml` file and run `cargo
update`:

```
[dependencies.cld2]
git = "git://github.com/emk/rust-cld2"
```

Then you can invoke it as follows:

``` rust
// Put these two lines the top of the file.
extern crate cld2;
use cld2::{detect_language, Format, Reliable, Lang};

let text = "It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?";

assert_eq!((Some(Lang("en")), Reliable),
           detect_language(text, Format::Text));
```

You can also pass in language detection hints and request more detailed
output.  For details, please see [the API documentation][apidoc].

### Contributing

As always, pull requests are welcome!  Please keep any patches as simple as
possible and include unit tests; that makes it much easier for me to merge
them.
